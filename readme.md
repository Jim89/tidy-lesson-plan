## Sample lesson

The instructions are to:

> Prepare a 15-minute lesson on a topic related to R, RStudio products, or data
> science and submit it to the examiner at least two days before your scheduled
> examination. Your submission should include (but is not restricted to):
> 1.  A learner persona characterizing the audience for the lesson.
> 2.  A concept map showing the mental model you intend to convey.
> 3.  At least one formative assessment (such as a multiple choice question or Parsons Problem).
> 4.  Any notebooks or slides you would use to support delivery of the lesson.


### Lesson concept

My plan is to teach a sample lesson about extracting data from a rectangle
using the `dplyr` package.

### Learner persona

Firstly, let's outline a learner persona.

#### General background - a specific example

* Jo is British-Nigerian, born and raised in London
* They now live in the US, having moved to attend medical school
* In their free time they enjoy baking, reading, and dancing

#### Starting point

* Jo has familiarity with data analysis, and has familarity with base R from
  their previous academic experience
* Jo is _aware of_ the `tidyverse`, but doesn't have experience using it
* Jo has taught themselves aspects of R in the past, and is confident that they
  can do it again

#### Needs

* Jo has volunteered to assist with some academic research, and will be the primary
  data analyst for the project, with limited support from others
* Jo knows that they may be sent several versions of the data, as their
  collaborators will be continually collecting results and re-providing the
  data, and doesn't want to have to re-code everything each time
* Jo knows their results will need to be reproducible as they will submit it to a
  journal

#### Special considerations

* As a medical student, they don't have a lot of time to learn extra material,
  and they will only want to focus on what's needed for them to get their
  research done.

#### Pitch

> "In this lesson, we're going to cover one of the _most important_ elements of
> data analysis: how to work with tablular data to extract just the bits of it
> that you need. We'll cover the two main applications: selecting columns and
> filtering rows, and show how to use both to get the subsets of data you need
> for your work."
