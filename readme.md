## Sample lesson

The instructions are to:

> Prepare a 15-minute lesson on a topic related to R, RStudio products, or data
> science and submit it to the examiner at least two days before your scheduled
> examination. Your submission should include (but is not restricted to):
> 1.  A learner persona characterizing the audience for the lesson.
> 2.  A concept map showing the mental model you intend to convey.
> 3.  At least one formative assessment (such as a multiple choice question or Parsons Problem).
> 4.  Any notebooks or slides you would use to support delivery of the lesson.

My plan is to teach a sample lesson about _selecting_ data from a rectangle.
